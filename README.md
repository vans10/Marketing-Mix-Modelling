# Marketing-Mix-Modelling
This project uses Marketing Mix Modeling to help Hope Street Cosmetics evaluate the ROI of its marketing efforts across online, offline, and other channels. Using Python and Excel-based tools, I decomposed sales into baseline and incremental drivers, identified high-performing tactics, and provided recommendations for optimal budget allocation.
